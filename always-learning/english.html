                <p>Managing a new language is always difficult, don't get ahead of yourself! go step step by step, remember to lay down your foundations well so that you can build on them, understand basics before moving on to intermediate or advanced. </p>

                <h2>Two</h2>
                <p> Include English in activities that you enjoy, it is very possible, for example: </br>- Watch series or movies with audio and subtitles in English </br>- Do karaoke in English of your favorite songs </br>- Read your favorite book in English </br>- Try to memorize and repeat your favorite movie phrases. </p>

                <h2>Three</h2>
                <p> Get a partner to practice with, preferably someone who is native or speaks English very well. It is not necessary for them to talk a lot, at first it is always difficult and even more so when you do not have that confidence, try to make it a pleasant conversation and where you can use the new words learned.</p>

                    <h2>Last but not Least</h2>
                    <p> Don't be ashamed to make a mistake! This is the main factor why many people are discouraged from learning English, whether in a conversation you pronounce something wrong and everyone laughs or you see that your friends learned faster than you do not be discouraged or ashamed, everyone has their rhythm, each one their way of learning. Imagine a finish line where everyone wants to get there, there are different paths but they all lead to the goal, each path has its obstacles but the main point is to never stop running (or even walking).</p>
