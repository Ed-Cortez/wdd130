            <h1>Is it good to listen to music while studying?</h1>
        </section>

        <section class="section-answer_1">
            <p>The answer varies from person to person, but a very useful exercise is to take the time it takes for an assignment without listening to music and then take the time it takes for a similar assignment to listen to music, measure your times and compare them. You can try different genres that you like</p>

        <section class="section-answer_2">
            <p>It is certainly more difficult, but remember that it is still social contact, only with less time, so take advantage of group conversations to find out something about your classmates or teachers (as long as they have nothing to do). Another way is through text messages, these are very common nowadays and if you don't want to seem like a bully you can start conversations by asking something that is not clear to you about the class or assignment.</p>
