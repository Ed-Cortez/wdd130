      <h3>English</h3>
      <p>
        
        1. Managing a new language is always difficult, don't get ahead of yourself! go step
        step by step, remember to lay down your foundations well so that you can build on them, understand
        basics before moving on to intermediate or advanced.

        2. Include English in activities that you enjoy, it is very possible, for example:
        - Watch series or movies with audio and subtitles in English
        - Do karaoke in English of your favorite songs
        - Read your favorite book in English
        - Try to memorize and repeat your favorite movie phrases.
      
        3. Get a partner to practice with, preferably someone who is native or speaks English very well. 
        It is not necessary for them to talk a lot, at first it is always difficult and even more so when you 
        do not have that confidence, try to make it a pleasant conversation and where you can use the new words learned.


        4. Don't be ashamed to make a mistake! This is the main factor why many people are discouraged from learning English, 
        whether in a conversation you pronounce something wrong and everyone laughs or you see that your friends learned faster 
        than you do not be discouraged or ashamed, everyone has their rhythm, each one their way of learning. Imagine a finish line 
        where everyone wants to get there, there are different paths but they all lead to the goal, each path has its obstacles but 
        the main point is to never stop running (or even walking).

      <h3>Learning</h3>
      <p>
          Learning has to be something you enjoy, so if you're not
         enjoying something is wrong. These are some tips when learning
         virtually.

         1. Learn to teach and teach to learn, it is scientifically proven that if someone
         share the knowledge learned with someone else will be much less likely to
         I forgot them.

         2. Everything has its time, if you are in college probably for every credit
         I know that he will ask for a certain time for you to dedicate to him, try to separate that time
         As much as you can do in less, use the remaining time to review the topics.

         3. Study or do your assignments in places where you won't be interrupted or distracted, being around 
         people who are doing more fun activities than studying will block you from concentrating on what you're 
         really doing, believe me, whenever I've tried to do my homework while others eat or talk around me I have 
         never been able to concentrate (keep in mind that some people do manage to concentrate, if this is your case, I envy you).

         4. Take small breaks while you study, you do not want to overexert yourself and then not want to touch a book again, 
         preferably small breaks every 25-50 minutes of study, this will help you not stress and refresh your mind to continue.

    <h3>FAQ</h3>
    <p>
      In this section we will answer the most common questions people ask. You are invited to
      leave your question.


      Is it good to listen to music while studying?
      - The answer varies from person to person, but a very useful exercise is to take the time 
      it takes for an assignment without listening to music and then take the time it takes for 
      a similar assignment to listen to music, measure your times and compare them. You can try 
      different genres that you like.

      How can I relate to my classmates and teachers if everything is virtual?
      - It is certainly more difficult, but remember that it is still social contact, only with 
      less time, so take advantage of group conversations to find out something about your classmates 
      or teachers (as long as they have nothing to do). Another way is through text messages, 
      these are very common nowadays and if you don't want to seem like a bully you can start 
      conversations by asking something that is not clear to you about the class or assignment.
