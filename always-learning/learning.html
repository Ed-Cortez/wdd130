                <p>Learn to teach and teach to learn, it is scientifically proven that if someone share the knowledge learned with someone else will be much less likely to it is forgotten. Try to teach every person around you, give them interesting facts about what you learned rather than a lesson </p>

                <h2>Two</h2>
                <p> Everything has its time, if you are in college probably for every credit I know that he will ask for a certain time for you to dedicate to it, but try to separate that time, It is really important! Once everything is done, use the remaining time to review the topics, this will help you be prepare for exams. </p>

                <h2>Three</h2>
                <p> Study or do your assignments in places where you won't be interrupted or distracted, being around people who are doing more fun activities than studying will block you from concentrating on what you're really doing, believe me, whenever I've tried to do my homework while others eat or talk around me I have never been able to concentrate (keep in mind that some people do manage to concentrate, if this is your case, I envy you).</p>

                    <h2>Last but not Least</h2>
                    <p> Take small breaks while you study, you do not want to overexert yourself and then not want to touch a book again, preferably small breaks every 25-50 minutes of study, this will help you not stress and refresh your mind to continue.</p>
